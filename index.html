    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>
        I am a creative, highly motivated UX/UI designer with 3+ years of experience specializing in UX/UI within the fields of SaaS
        and healthcare technology, fostering user-centric design and a collaborative atmosphere. As an accomplished degree holder
        with technical skills in user experience design, I have been able to deliver concepts, wireframes, and prototypes on-time

        meet challenging project deadlines with top notch output. I am an effective communicator who has built positive
        relationships with team members and clients in order to work towards common business objectives. I am seeking to grow
        my experience within the field of UX & UI Design with a company that aligns with my values and my mission to serve others.
